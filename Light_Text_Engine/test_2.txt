Atop the mantlepiece

Dark.
Dark and cold.
That is all you know, all you have known, imprisoned as you are.
You know not how long you have been here, there is no sense of time.
Nothing to judge the days by.
Just the dark.
And the cold.

Light.
People.
A face looks down at you from atop your cell.
A face.
How long has it been since you last saw a face?
You want to cry out for help, scream, yell but find you have no mouth.
Nor hands.
Nor legs.
Nor body.
You are amorphous, abstract, forgotten.
A soul collected, cataloged, and contained in an artificial vessel.
A hand reaches down, palming your body in its entirety. 
Warmth radiates through the glass ampoule that holds you.

They are saying something, if only you had ears to listen.
Friends. 
Companions.
One by one you are passed around the party.
They shake you. Tilt you. Weigh you.
None seem to know what you are.
One moves to break the neck of your ampoule, but is stopped.

Their dress is odd, nothing you have seen before.
They do not seem to be soldiers.
Then they must be raiders.
Bandits.
Pillagers.
Barbarians. 
Why else would they be here now?

One of the rabble is not like the others.
Thin, frail limbs.
Dull, silver eyes.
Long, pointed ears.
You recognize your own kind. 
What is she doing here amongst criminals?
She must be a traitor.
Betrayer.
Fiend.
You two are more alike than you admit.

Once more you try to talk.
Something happens.
Your words drift outward.
Your voice is piercing.
On your tongue a single phrase:
"Don’t leave me!"

Long ears twitch.
Dull eyes narrow.
She has heard. 
The rest have not.
She will not let them have her prize.
